# My Personal Portfolio

You can see the live demo by clicking on this link: [LIVE DEMO](https://lakpro.github.io/port-mob/)

I have used HTML/CSS/JavaScript along with some Bootstrap.
I have also used an AAPI to make the form work. 
Due to the limitations of the free API, there are only a limited requests per month.

ðŸ’¡ The live background that you see is dynamic in color. So, everytime you reload the page, it will show a different color than the previous.
